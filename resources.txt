* 2017-06-26 ids and references

        <p>A method that solves this problem is the use of references. In a C or assembler, you could use a
          pointer. In C++, a reference might be used. In Java, a reference value might be used.</p>

        <p>The XML standard
          establishes ID and IDREF attributes. method defined by the XML standard is the use of ID and IDREF. An IDREF refers to an ID. NIEM uses this
          method and assigns to it specific semantics.</p>

        <p>Naive solutions to these problems that use only content elements require techniques such as repeating
          data and identifying and excluding duplicate data; these operation entail the use of excess storage and
          processing time.</p>

          <title>Uniform identifiers in NIEM data</title>

          <p>The linked data methodology labels things with unique names, called URIs (uniform resource
            identifiers). If two things have the same URI, then they are the same thing.</p>

          <p>NIEM supports the linked data methodolog</p>
