SERIOUSLY need to rebuild the make system. It's a freaking mess.

Replace the delegated makefile with a single makefile that blocks off unwanted operations in ifneq/endif blocks.

* building
- functions
  - functions are built in doc/nf-impl

* todo
- [ ] add rule: thing with representation term "Abstract" must be @abstract=true
