Need to determine how to deal with hyphenated terms:

  center-line
  co-defendant
  co-worker
  log-on
  non-empty
  watch-list

How to deal with multi-word terms

  main line (not mainline)
  pass code (not passcode)
  web site (not website)

The word used is not the predominant spelling:

  dependent (dependant is predominant when it is a noun)
