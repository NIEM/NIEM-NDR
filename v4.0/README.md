The NIEM Naming and Design Rules specifies the data model, XML Schema
components, and XML data for use with the National Information Exchange Model.

The NDR is governed by the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC), with
input from the NIEM Business Architecture Committee (NBAC) and the community.

Please submit comments on this specification as issues at
https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-NDR/issues.

Machine-readable rules in the NDR are available as Schematron documents in this
repository. You may also test against the rules using
[the Conformance Testing Assistant (Contesa) for NIEM at https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/),
which features NIEM 3 rules and latest NIEM 4 rules.
