* stack: add to top
* Tasks & issues: sort first to top

** completed tasks: put new at bottom

- [ ] Change rule: [[file:src/ndr-doc.xml.m4::<ruleSection><title>Metadata%20type%20has%20data%20about%20data</title][constraint rule]] to interpretation rule

** Someday / maybe

- [ ] get rid of &gt; and &lt;, prefer xpath gt and lt
- [ ] add check: any component in the target namespace MUST be declared within the schema
- [ ] add Schematron for rules without Schematron
- [ ] Lighten EXT structural rules
- [ ] use MACRO_REPRESENTATION_TERM_QUANTITY, and the other like macros, universally across the document. They're only used in some places.
- [ ] clean up straggler uses of term "content element" and "reference element".

* Changes from 3.0 to 4.0

- Merged local terminology into appinfo.
- Defined new attribute @uri, supporting linked data-style content.
- Updated the NIEM conceptual model's use of RDF to align with linked data & JSON-LD.
- Allowed @fixed on required attribute uses, supported by better description of the effects of infoset augmentation by XML Schema validating parsers.
- Prohibited @fixed on simpletype facets in reference schemas.
- Changed naming rules from MUST to SHOULD.
- Added naming rule that element and attributes of code types have names ending in "Code".
- Removed Schematron from rules that always provide warnings.
- Made text, spelling, and grammar corrections.
- Allowed code types that are not based on XML Schema enumerations.
- Allowed all legal ASCII characters in component names, now allowing hyphen, underscore, and period.
- Broke up large composite rules about standard opening phrases into a set of smaller, simpler rules.

* Agendas: discuss with:
** NTAC
*** code updates:
**** complex: 
- updated definition of "code type"
  - to: A code type is a NIEM object type for which each simple value carried by the type corresponds to an entry in a list of distinct conceptual entities.
  - from: A code type is a NIEM object type with a content model that is constrained by one or more enumeration facets.
- rule 10-17: Name of code type ends in CodeType
  - from: bidirectional: A complex type definition MUST have a {name} that ends in 'CodeType' if and only if it has a {base type definition} of a code type or code simple type.
  - to: one-directional: A complex type definition a {base type definition} of a code type or code simple type SHOULD have a {name} that ends in 'CodeType'.
- new: Rule 10-18. Code type corresponds to a code list
  - [Rule 10-18] (REF, EXT) (Constraint)
    - A complex type SHOULD have a name ending in CodeType if and only if it has a correspondence to a list of distinct conceptual entities.
****  simple 
    - new definition of "code simple type":
      - to: A code simple type is a simple type definition schema component for which each value carried by the type corresponds to an entry in a list of distinct conceptual entities.
      - from: A code simple type is a simple type definition schema component that is constrained by one or more enumeration facets.
  - new rule (currently 11-10):
    - Rule 11-10. (REF, EXT) (Constraint) Code simple type corresponds to a code list
      - A simple type SHOULD have a name ending in CodeSimpleType if and only if it has a correspondence to a list of distinct conceptual entities.
    - stands down old rule 11-10: Code simple type has enumerations
*** removed always-firing schematron rules
- Schema is CTAS-conformant
- Document is a schema document
- Document uses XML namespaces properly
- Target namespace is absolute URI
- Document is an XML document
** CDM
- [ ] Did Representations get screwed up? Now they're "RepresentationAbstract"?

* Document conventions:

1. The user/developer is a "she" / "her", unless there are multiples, in which cases the 2nd may be a "he".
2. Only put rules in as "SET" rules if it adds something above & beyond the REF/EXT checks. Like add'l cross-schema validations. Or if it needs to be checked on files that aren't REF/EXT, like external schemas.
3. Keep document references in Zotero
   1. Enter niem specs as type 'document'
   2. Generate citations as "Chicago Manual of Style 16th edition (full note)"

* Tree of types

- simple: Simple Type (name = *SimpleType)
  - code: code simple type
- complex: Complex type (otherwise)  
  - association: AssociationType (name = *AssociationType)
  - metadata: Metadata type (name = *MetadataType)
  - augmentation: AugmentationType (name = *AugmentationType)

      - proxy: Proxy type
      - role: role type

complex types by name, in conformant schema:

  - *AssociationType
  - *MetadataType
  - *AugmentationType
  - otherwise: object type

* Tree of elements

- Metadata element
- Association element

* Conformant schema patterns

  - target namespace: nf:get-target-namespace(.)
  - structures namespace: xs:anyURI('MACRO_NS_STRUCTURES') 
  - the XML Schema namespace: xs:anyURI('MACRO_NS_XS')
  - The XML namespace: anyURI('MACRO_NS_XML') http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

An AUGMENTABLE TYPE is:

    - object :
